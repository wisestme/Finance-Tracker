## Introduction.
You should have git install by now. In addition, you should also install the GUI App (GitHub Desktop). If you've not installed GitHub Desktop, install it now [from here](https://desktop.github.com/).   
Now use the **Clone or Download** button to clone this repository to your computer. Select, **Open in Desktop** and wait. See how seamlessly it works?
